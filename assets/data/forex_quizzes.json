      "The number of pairs available",
      "Your profit percentage"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Volatility measures the degree of price fluctuation over a period. High volatility means large price swings, offering more profit potential but also higher risk. Low volatility indicates stable, range-bound movement. Different pairs and timeframes have different volatility levels."

    "correct": 1,

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A double top is a bearish reversal pattern where price reaches a resistance level twice and fails to break through, forming two peaks at similar heights. When price breaks below the support level between the peaks, it confirms the pattern and signals a downtrend."
